**The Oracle Problem in Bulk API Validation**
**Module:** `force::api::bulk::types` and `force::api::bulk::query`
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Finding:** The `apiVersion` field serialization was missing the `default` attribute prior to `skip_serializing_if`, causing Serde deserialization to fail on JSON where `apiVersion` was missing entirely, but `cargo mutants` revealed that this failure mode was untested and masked.
**Evidence:** The `test_job_info_deserialization` tests failed when `cargo mutants` perturbed the `serde` payload structure to omit `apiVersion` because the custom deserializer `deserialize_optional_string_or_number` bypassed `Option`'s natural missing-field fallback without an explicit `default` tag.
**Recommendation:** Sentry must add `default` to any `Option<T>` field that also uses `deserialize_with`, and ensure a test exists that parses a minimal JSON object where every single optional field is missing, not just `null`.

**[Elenchus: deserialize_optional_string_or_number test strengthening]**
**Module:** `crates/force/src/api/bulk/types.rs`
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Finding:** The custom deserializer for `Option<String>` bypassed Serde's natural missing-field fallback when the field was completely absent from the JSON payload. `cargo mutants` exposed that the tests did not cover missing fields, empty strings, or arbitrary strings, providing false confidence.
**Evidence:** `cargo mutants` showed 3 surviving mutants in the implementation. Serde fails to deserialize completely missing fields unless the `#[serde(default)]` attribute is present on the `Option` field.
**Recommendation:** Add the explicit `#[serde(default)]` attribute to the test struct `Wrapper`. Enhance the tests to explicitly assert behavior for completely absent fields (`{}`), empty strings (`{"value": ""}`), and arbitrary strings (`{"value": "xyzzy"}`). Explicitly handle the `Null` variant internally in `StringOrNumber` to safely convert literal nulls to `None`.
**[Elenchus: QueryStream missing empty middle page fetch test]**
**Module:** `crates/force/src/api/bulk/query.rs`
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Finding:** `QueryStream::next()` failed to loop properly when an empty middle page was fetched, immediately marking the stream as exhausted. `cargo mutants` exposed that this path was not tested at all.
**Evidence:** `cargo mutants` mutated `if self.records.is_empty()` replacing the condition causing early termination and no tests failed.
**Recommendation:** Wrap the fetching logic inside `QueryStream::next()` in a `loop` so that if an empty page is fetched but `next_locator` is still present, the stream fetches the next page. Add a test `test_query_results_fetch_csv_data_empty_middle_page` to simulate an empty middle page using `wiremock`.

**[Weak Response Verification]**
**Module:** crates::force::http::tests
**Severity:** 🟡 Suspect
**Finding:** Multiple integration tests in the HTTP executor test suite verified successful execution by asserting the result was `Ok` via `.must()` but neglected to assert the resulting response payload (e.g. `assert_eq!(response.status(), 200)`). A test that merely executes logic and drops the output can mask behavioral changes.
**Evidence:** `test_401_triggers_token_refresh_and_retry`, `test_503_retries_with_exponential_backoff`, `test_503_can_retry_mutation_with_explicit_policy`, `test_telemetry_hooks_capture_retry_and_completion`, and `test_network_timeout_retries` all used `let _ = result.must();` without verifying the actual `reqwest::Response` status code.
**Recommendation:** Replaced `let _ = result.must();` with explicit `let response = result.must(); assert_eq!(response.status(), 200);` to ensure the mock endpoint successfully returned the expected success status.
