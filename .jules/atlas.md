**2024-05-22 - [The Knot: ForceClient vs API Handlers]**
**Tangle:** The `client` module (containing `ForceClient`) depends on `api` modules (`rest`, `bulk`) to expose handlers via methods like `client.rest()`. However, these handlers depend back on the `client` module to access the `Inner` struct which holds the shared state (HTTP client, config, token manager). This creates a circular dependency between `client` and `api` at the module level.
**Blueprint:** Extract the `Inner` struct and its implementation into a new leaf module `client::inner`. The `api` handlers will then depend on `client::inner` instead of the top-level `client` module. `ForceClient` will depend on `client::inner` and `api`. This breaks the cycle and establishes a clear DAG: `client` -> `api` -> `client::inner`.
